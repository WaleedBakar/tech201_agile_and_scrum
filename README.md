## What is agile?



Agile is a methodology for project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Agile methodologies are based on the Agile Manifesto, a set of values and principles that prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, and customer collaboration over processes and tools.

Agile methodologies are designed to be adaptive and responsive to change, allowing teams to quickly and efficiently deliver working software and continuously improve the process. This is in contrast to traditional, "waterfall" methodologies, which are more rigid and linear, with distinct phases of development that must be completed before moving on to the next.

Some popular Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). These methodologies have different practices and ceremonies but share the same philosophy of Agile.

Both Agile and DevOps also emphasizes on continuous improvement, collaboration and communication across DevOps and testing teams.
